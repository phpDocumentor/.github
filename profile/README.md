The phpDocumentor organization maintains a group of projects 
that aim to provide the PHP community with a set of high quality
documentation tools. We are building phpDocumentor to generate
your documentation in HTML format. But we also provide libraries
used by thousands of projects to extract type information from
your code.

We do this with a small team of volunteers for more than 20 years
now. If you want to help us, please consider [sponsoring us](https://github.com/sponsors/phpDocumentor).
